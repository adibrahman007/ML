# ML

This is a repo where I post my python solutions to the coursera course Machine learning.
The solutions can be found in the .ipynb (notebook) file in respective folder.

The way I thought that I would present my solutions is to tell the story by using these notebooks. I think this is a good way to illustrate the code and my thought process when it comes to implementing these algorithms, and it gives me an opportunity to play around with the very cool notebook-concept. The code together with more personal and (very!) messy notes for myself can be found in the corresponding .py file and the instructions for this assignment can also be found in the corresponding .pdf file. the github for these exercises are: https://github.com/gurbraj/ML and there you can also follow the commits i've done while working through these excellent exercises. The commits more accurately describes the actual work flow for arriving to the solutions.
